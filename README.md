# obfuscation-library
First Version
(sorry for my bad english)
This class is one of my library classes.
it takes an associative array and obfuscates it, with some added security features against manipulation.
i use it mostly for obfuscating complex GET Parameters, and to protect them against light attacks

when the class is called for the first time it creates a config file with random values to obfuscate the array.

An simple example is added at the bottom of the class

The class is based on an script from 2013 written by me, so some parts are cleaner then other.

Comments will be added in a later version maybe 1.1

stay tuned
